                <h3>To my baby</h3>
                <p>  We might be miles apart, but our hearts are always together. I find myself counting down the moments until we can celebrate this day side by side. Until then, know that you are in my thoughts, and my love for you only grows stronger with each passing day.

                    I cherish every memory we've created together and eagerly anticipate the many more to come. Your love has been a source of joy, strength, and inspiration in my life.
                    
                    I want to express my deep gratitude for having you by my side. You are the warmth in my heart, the light in my darkest days, and the reason for my smiles. Thank you for being my partner in this incredible journey.
                    
                    Though we may be physically apart, but our connection transcends any distance. Today and every day, you are my Valentine, and I hold you close in my thoughts and heart.
                    
                    Wishing us a day filled with love, joy, and the promise of a future where we can celebrate many more Valentine's Days together.
                    
                    Love you endlessly. Happy Valentine's day.
